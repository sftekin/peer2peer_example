an image is an excellent difficult highlevel computer vision problem whose time has come the emergence of vast amounts of geographicallycalibrated image data is a great reason for computer vision to start looking globally on the scale of the entire planet in this paper we propose a simple algorithm for estimating a distribution over geographic locations from a single image using a purely datadriven scene matching approach for this task we will leverage a dataset of over 6 million gpstagged images from the internet we represent the estimated image location as a probability distribution over the earths surface we quantitatively evaluate our approach in several geolocation tasks and demonstrate encouraging performance up to 30 times better than chance we show that geolocation estimates can provide the basis for numerous other image understanding tasks such as population density estimation land cover estimation or urbanrural classification what can you do with a million images in this paper we present a new image completion algorithm powered by a huge database of photographs gathered from the web the algorithm patches up holes in images by finding similar image regions in the database that are not only seamless but also semantically valid our chief insight is that while the space of images is effectively infinite the space of semantically differentiable scenes is actually not that large for many image completion tasks we are able to find similar scenes which contain image fragments that will convincingly complete the image our algorithm is entirely datadriven requiring no annotations or labelling by the user unlike existing image completion methods our algorithm can generate a diverse set of image completions and we allow users to select among them we demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over existing image completion approaches this research project was primarily eugenes work and i played only a small role we introduce a novel image segmentation algorithm that uses translational symmetry as the primary foregroundbackground separation cue we use texturebased inpainting to recover an unoccluded background we find arbitrarily distorted regular patterns in real images by treating latticefinding as a higherorder assignment problem we leverage from marius leordeanu and martial hebert to approximate the optimal assignment under secondorder constraints source code available upon request although by et al is likely more accurate and faster quantitative evaluation is difficult for texture synthesis ground truth is not well defined but for certain textures you can objectively decide whether an algorithm has failed ", "span": ""}},

issued to date i have been prototyping wearable computers in academia since 1990 and own one of the which has been shown in museums worldwide our discovery and development of passive haptic learning and passive haptic rehabilitation allows wearable computer users to learn complex manual skills like playing the piano or typing braille with little or no attention on the learning our preliminary

approach can be used to incorporate additional information such as attributes of the usersobjectsa feature currently lacking in existing regularizationbased cf approachesusing popular and wellknown kernel methods we provide novel representer theorems that we use to develop new estimation methods we then provide learning algorithms based on lowrank decompositions and test them on a standard cf data set the experiments indicate the advantages of generalizing the existing regularizationbased cf methods to incorporate related information about users and objects finally we show that certain

beach california usa pmlr retrieved from httpproceedingsmlrpressv97cardoso19ahtml we study the problem of repeated play in a zerosum game in which the payoff matrix may change in a possibly adversarial fashion on each round we call these online matrix games finding the nash equilibrium ne of a two player zerosum game is core to many problems in statistics optimization and economics and for a fixed game matrix this can be easily reduced to solving a linear program but when the payoff matrix evolves over time our goal is to find a sequential algorithm that can compete with in a certain sense the ne of the longtermaveraged payoff matrix we design an algorithm with small ne regretthat is we ensure that the longterm payoff of both players is close to minimax optimum in hindsight our algorithm achieves nearoptimal dependence with respect to the number of rounds and depends polylogarithmically on the number of available actions of the players additionally we show that the naive reduction where each player simply minimizes its own regret fails to achieve the stated objective regardless of which algorithm is used lastly we consider the socalled bandit setting where the feedback is significantly limited and we provide an algorithm with small ne regret using onepoint estimates of each payoff matrix wang jk abernethy j d 2018 acceleration through optimistic

a joint initiative with engineering in computational materials he was on the founding editorial board of magazine and was founding editorinchief of and he also founded the nonprofit atlanta autism consortium in 2008 to serve and unite the various stakeholder communities in atlanta connected to autism research and services dean abowds contributions to the fields of humancomputer interaction and ubiquitous computing have been recognized through numerous awards in 2008 he was named a fellow of the association for computing machinery that same year he was inducted into the acm chi academy the most prestigious honor for researchers in hci in 2009 he received the acm eugene lawler humanitarian award for his work in autism and technology as of 2020 he graduated 30 phd students 20 of whom have gone on to successful careers at top universities around the world dr abowd received the degree of bs in honors mathematics in 1986 from the university of notre dame he then attended the university of

interests lie in the intersection between software engineering and humancomputer interaction specifically he is interested in ubiquitous computing ubicomp and the research issues involved in building and evaluating ubicomp applications that impact our everyday lives when they are seamlessly integrated into our living spaces his research involves the applicationdriven aspects of mobile and ubiquitous computing his approach is fundamentally humancentered but with an emphasis on how technologies can be developed to address opportunities or challenges the challenges for designing implementing and evolving hardware and software for everyday human use that runs reliably continuously and appropriately on the wide variety of worn held and embedded platforms are numerous and complex from the humancentered perspective significant research themes emerge when new computing technology is put into reallife situations to date dr abowd has led a group of that has examined such living laboratories in application domains of education personal information management life in the home and health management the research themes to have emerged from such work are automated capture and access to live experiences contextaware applications and natural interfaces between the physical and electronic worlds a significant research theme that has resulted from his personal motivation
